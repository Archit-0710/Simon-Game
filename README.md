# Simon-Game
Simon is a classic memory game that tests your pattern-recognition and memory skills. This game consists of a console with four colored buttons (usually red, blue, green, and yellow) that light up and produce distinct sounds. The objective of the game is to follow and repeat an ever-lengthening sequence of button presses generated by the console.
